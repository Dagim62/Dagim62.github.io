            <p>After 13,824,000 seconds of loving someone from 1,287 miles away, today was the day everything changed. It was the final day of waiting the day I‚Äôd break the invisible wall that long-distance had built between me and the girl who had become my entire world.</p>
            <p>My heart was racing as I boarded the plane at Reagan National Airport. Nervousness and excitement fought for space in my chest, each emotion pushing the other aside like waves crashing on a shore. As soon as I found my seat, I whispered to myself, ‚ÄúWhy is this plane going so slow?‚Äù</p>
            <p>When we took off, I closed my eyes for a second and asked, ‚ÄúAm I dreaming?‚Äù It didn‚Äôt feel real. After all this time, after countless calls, messages, and imagined hugs, I was finally flying to her.</p>
            <p>The first leg of the trip ended in Denver. But instead of calming down, my emotions grew even more intense. My hands trembled slightly as I held my boarding pass for the final flight to Oklahoma City. Somewhere deep in my mind, I could almost hear the voice of my future self calm, proud, full of love telling me, ‚ÄúYou did it. I‚Äôm proud of you for making this real.‚Äù</p>
            <p>The plane landed. My heart pounded harder than ever before. As I stepped off and walked through the terminal, I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. I hadn‚Äôt imagined the exact moment we would reunite. I didn‚Äôt know if I would cry, freeze, or just collapse into her arms.</p>
            <p>And then I saw her. In that instant, the world paused. Every sound faded, every movement blurred. My entire body stopped for just one breathtaking second. And then I ran to her. We wrapped each other in the tightest hug, the kind you give someone you never want to let go of. I kissed her, long and full of everything words could never say.</p>
            <p>We didn‚Äôt say much at first. We didn‚Äôt need to. We just smiled like we‚Äôd finally found home. After that, we got into the car and drove to our Airbnb, our fingers intertwined the entire way. That night, we were no longer just voices over the phone or faces behind screens we were real, right there, side by side.</p>
